With recent advancements in quantum hardware and the implementation of quantum error correction codes, the prospect of developing an early fault-tolerant quantum computer within the next two decades has become increasingly promising. The potential applications of such a quantum computer, particularly in solving complex problems in quantum chemistry or quantum many-body systems, are garnering significant attention. In this talk, we aim to provide an in-depth introduction to Block Encoding, a pivotal first step in unlocking the capabilities of quantum computers for these applications. Our discussion will delve into the latest developments of block encoding, explore a fundamental theorem related to this technique.
