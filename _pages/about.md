I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I work under the guidance of Prof. Luskin, and my main mathematical interests lie in __numerical analysis__, __applied analysis__, and __mathematical physics__, particularly in the context of quantum materials science and quantum technology. 

I’m also excited to explore using the __machine learning__ and __quantum computer__ for __scientific computing__, with a focus on condensed matter problems. 


Beyond my passion for mathematics and algorithms, I have a deep interest in the sciences, particularly in exploring and understanding quantum phenomena. I strive to make daily progress in mathematics, numerical methods, and physical sciences. My ultimate goal is to become an applied mathematician and physicist, though I envision my future work incorporating elements of chemistry or computer science as well.

I am organizing a __quantum error correction seminar__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025. 

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD modeling from Multi-scale

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System
