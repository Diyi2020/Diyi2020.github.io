I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I work under the guidance of Prof. Luskin, and my main mathematical interests lie in __numerical analysis__, __applied analysis__, and __mathematical physics__, particularly in the context of quantum materials science and quantum technology.

I’m also excited to explore using the __machine learning__ and __quantum computer__ for __scientific computing__, with a focus on condensed matter problems. Outside of math and algorithms, I have a strong interest in the sciences, and I’m constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of quantum phenomena.

I am organizing a __quantum error correction reading group__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025. 

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD modeling from Multi-scale analysis

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System

This year, I am less active on a few directions including multi-grid methods, DFT and scientific machine learning but always happy to have more discussion on these topics.
