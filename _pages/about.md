I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I work under the guidance of Prof. Luskin, and my main mathematical interests lie in __numerical analysis__, __applied analysis__, and __mathematical physics__, particularly in the context of quantum materials science and quantum computing.

I’m also excited to explore the machine learning and quantum computing for __scientific computing__, with a focus on condensed matter problems. Outside of math and algorithms, I have a strong interest in the sciences, and I’m constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of quantum phenomena including electronic properties.

I am organizing a __quantum error correction seminar__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025. The main goal is to understand __why a quantum computer can be built__. Very Very recently, I am convinced that quantum computer can be built and maybe within __one__ decade.

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD modeling and multi-scale analysis

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System
