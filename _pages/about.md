I am interested in Computational and Applied Mathematics and developing numerical methods and mathematical tools based on applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics and Medical Science. My advisor is Prof Luskin and most of my mathematcial interests go into numerical analysis, applied analysis, mathematical physics related to __quantum material science__ and __quantum technology__. 

Moreover, I am also interested in exploring using machine learning and quantum computer for scientifc computing with a focus on condensed matter related problems.

I am organizing a quantum error correction seminar from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System
