I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I work under the guidance of Prof. Luskin, and my main mathematical interests lie in __numerical analysis__, __applied analysis__, and __mathematical physics__, particularly in the context of quantum materials science and quantum technology. 

I’m also excited to explore using the __machine learning__ and __quantum computer__ for __scientific computing__, with a focus on condensed matter problems and electronic strucutre. 


Beyond my passion for mathematics and algorithms, I have deep interests in the sciences, particularly in exploring and understanding quantum phenomena. I strive to make daily progress in mathematics, numerical methods, and physical sciences. 

I am organizing a __quantum error correction seminar__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025. 

Recent focus: 

1. TMD modeling

2. Block Encoding
   
3. Mixing Time and Groud State Preparation with Open Quantum System
