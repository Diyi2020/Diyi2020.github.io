I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I work under the guidance of Prof. Luskin, and my main mathematical interests lie in numerical analysis, applied analysis, and mathematical physics, particularly in the context of __quantum materials__ and __quantum technology__.

I’m also excited to explore the machine learning and quantum computing for scientific computing, with a focus on condensed matter problems. I find *multi-scale* methods and *first-principles* approaches in scientific computing particularly fascinating. Outside of math and algorithms, I have a strong interest in the sciences, and I’m constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of quantum phenomena in exotic materials.

I am organizing a __quantum error correction seminar__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System
