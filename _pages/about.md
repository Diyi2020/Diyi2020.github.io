I’m passionate about Computational and Applied Mathematics, especially in developing numerical methods and mathematical tools for applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics, and Medical Science. I am now a postdoc scholar at Berkeley Lab, and my main mathematical interests lie in __numerical analysis__, applied analysis, and mathematical physics, particularly in the context of __quantum materials science and quantum technology__. 

I’m also excited to explore using the machine learning and quantum computer for __scientific computing__, with a focus on condensed matter problems and electronic strucutre. 


Beyond my passion for mathematics and algorithms, I have deep interests in the sciences, particularly in exploring and understanding quantum phenomena. I strive to make daily progress in mathematics, numerical methods, and physical sciences. 

Recent focus: 

1. TMD modeling

2. Block Encoding
   
3. Open Quantum System
