I am interested in Computational and Applied Mathematics and developing numerical methods and mathematical tools based on applications in Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics and Medical Science. My advisor is Prof Luskin and most of my mathematcial interests go into numerical analysis, applied analysis, mathematical physics related to __quantum material science__ and __quantum technology__. 

Moreover, I am also interested in exploring using machine learning and quantum computer for __scientifc computing__ with a focus on condensed matter related problems. Besides math and algorithms, I have some interests in sciences and try to understand the quantum phenomenon in exotic materials and chemical reaction.

I am organizing a __quantum error correction seminar__ from Spring 2024 to Winter 2025

Recent focus:

1. __Moire materials__: TMD

2. __Quantum Algorithms__: Block Encoding and Open Quantum System

I am happy to host DRPs for a few topics including (1)Interacting electrons and Numerical Methods (2) Error Correction (3) Advanced analysis: semiclassical analysis/harmonic analysis.
